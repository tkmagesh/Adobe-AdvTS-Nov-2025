# Type System Programming

## Objectives
- Treat `types` as data
- Process `types` 
    - Use variables on `types`
    - Use conditional logic on `types` (branching)
    - Do iterations on `types` (loops)
    - Perform equality (==)
- Build an efficient `type system` that can catch a lot of bugs during the compilation itself
    - Ensure that the `type system` is maintainable
        - Avoid duplications in the `type` code
- Represent the **domain** concerns in `type` code
